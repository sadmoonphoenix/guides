# Emulation

Game emulation can be a scary topic for some, but it is actually quite easy to get started with. 
For this guide, we will use RetroArch.

## Windows
Head over to [the RetroArch Website](https://www.retroarch.com/index.php?page=platforms).
If it detects that you are using Windows correctly, press "Download Stable"
Then open up the installer and go through a normal installation process. 

## macOS
Head over to [the RetroArch Website](https://www.retroarch.com/index.php?page=platforms).
If it detects that you are using Windows correctly, press "Download Stable (Metal)"
Note: The Metal renderer does have some bugs as of right now, but since Apple will be removing OpenGL support soon, Metal is advised. 
Then open up the installer and go through a normal installation process.

## Linux
Idealy, you should get RetroArch from your package manager. Here's a couple distros.

### Ubuntu and derivatives (Linux Mint, Pop_OS!, KDE Neon, ElementaryOS, Zorin OS, etc)
Open up Terminal.
Run `sudo add-apt-repository ppa:libretro/stable && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install retroarch`

### Fedora and similar
Open up Terminal.
Run `sudo dnf install retroarch retroarch-assets retroarch-database retroarch-filters`

### Arch and derivatives (Manjaro, EndeavourOS, etc)
Open up Terminal. 
Run `sudo pacman -S retroarch retroarch-assets`

### Other distros

Otherwise, download the Flatpak or Steam version
